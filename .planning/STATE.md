# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-18)

**Core value:** A single, fast, dependency-free Go binary that reproduces the fun of `cowsay` — message in, ASCII animal out — with no Perl, no external `.cow` files, and a gopher on by default.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — First Runnable

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Vertical MVP structure — Phase 1 ships a runnable `gosay "hello"` with gopher default
- Roadmap: `cows/NOTICE` and `.gitattributes` land in Phase 1, before any public commit of vendored files
- Roadmap: `daemon.cow` included in Phase 1 vendor; provenance caveat documented in `cows/NOTICE`
- Roadmap: Single `gosay` binary only; no separate `cowthink` binary (`--think` flag covers the use case)
- Roadmap: `go-runewidth` is the one justified external dependency; pulled in during Phase 3

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- `gopher.cow`: hand-authored ASCII art derived from the Go mascot (user decision 2026-05-18); must land in Phase 1
- `daemon.cow`: included in the vendor set (user decision 2026-05-18); provenance caveat will be noted in `cows/NOTICE`
